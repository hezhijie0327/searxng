## Repository

Fork of [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) (metasearch engine, Python/Flask + Jinja2).
Current working branch: `skin`. The purpose of this fork is the custom theme
**zjsearch** — a from-scratch React + TypeScript UI — alongside the upstream
`simple` theme, **without modifying any Python code**.

Key directories:

- `searx/` — SearXNG core (webapp.py, search, engines, templates). Avoid editing.
- `searx/templates/zjsearch/` — zjsearch theme templates ("data shells").
- `searx/templates/zjsearch/data/macros.html` — the server → client data contract.
- `client/zjsearch/` — React 19 + TS + Vite 8 + Tailwind v4 workspace for zjsearch.
- `client/simple/`, `searx/templates/simple/` — upstream theme, do not refactor.
- `searx/static/themes/<theme>/` — built assets (committed to git, like upstream).
- `utils/lib_sxng_themes.sh`, `utils/lib_sxng_vite.sh` — make targets for themes.

## Commands

```sh
make themes.zjsearch        # npm install + vite build -> searx/static/themes/zjsearch
make themes.zjsearch.lint   # biome check + tsc --noEmit (run inside client/zjsearch)
make themes.zjsearch.dev    # vite dev server (HMR), proxies API calls to :8888
make run                    # dev instance on http://127.0.0.1:8888 (granian, reloads ./searx)
```

- Local instance for theme work (default_theme: zjsearch, all search formats on):
  `SEARXNG_SETTINGS_PATH=$PWD/client/zjsearch/dev-settings.yml ./manage webapp.run`
- First setup: `./manage pyenv.install` (Python venv in `./local/py3`).
- Theme changes require `make themes.zjsearch`; the browser caches assets for 30 s
  (WhiteNoise), reload twice or wait after rebuilding.

## zjsearch architecture (Page-Data pattern)

The server renders **no UI**. Every zjsearch Jinja template is a thin shell that
serializes the render context into `<script id="page-data" type="application/json">`
and boots `zjsearch.min.js`; React renders 100% of the interface.

- The data contract lives in `searx/templates/zjsearch/data/macros.html` and is
  mirrored by TS types in `client/zjsearch/src/lib/types.ts`. **Keep both in sync.**
- Macros apply server filters during serialization: `image_proxify`, `favicon_url`,
  `get_pretty_url`, query highlighting (`title_html`/`content_html` are escaped
  HTML — render with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
- Client-side navigation (`src/lib/router.tsx`) fetches the same URLs and extracts
  the embedded page-data JSON from the HTML response; on network failure it falls
  back to a full page load.
- Client settings come from the base64 `client_settings` attribute on the module
  script tag (`get_client_settings()` in webapp.py). Note: its `theme_static_path`
  is hardcoded to the simple theme — zjsearch uses its own `THEME_STATIC` constant.
- i18n: all UI strings are translated server-side into `globals.strings` (see the
  `_strings()` macro). Use msgids that match `searx/translations/*.po` exactly
  (e.g. lowercase `_('auto')`, not `_('Auto')`) or translations silently fall back.
- About/Stats/Preferences open as slide-in drawers (`src/lib/overlay.tsx`); the
  panel fetches page-data and renders the same page components with
  `embedded`/`hideTopNav` props. Internal links inside a panel are browsed within
  the panel (click-capture in overlay.tsx).

## Conventions & gotchas

- Jinja macros need `with context` imports to see render variables; Jinja macro
  output is Markup (never escaped), and `|tojson` is the only safe way to embed
  dynamic values — hand-built JSON must place `, ` separators **between** items,
  never before a closing brace.
- Theme style light/dark uses the `simple_style` cookie; `black` is OLED black
  (html gets both `dark` and `black` classes). Auto = no cookie + system setting.
  The html class is set by an inline script in `base.html` and mirrored by
  `applyThemeStyle()` in `client/zjsearch/src/lib/theme.ts` — keep both in sync.
- `POST /preferences` form semantics (upstream `Preferences.parse_form`):
  absent booleans are false; absent `category_*` clears the category
  selection; **`engine_<name>__<category>` and `plugin_<id>` are REVERSED —
  a posted key marks that engine/plugin as *disabled***, and every omitted
  key is re-enabled (a save must always post the complete disabled set);
  other absent key/value settings are left unchanged. The preferences UI
  auto-saves (debounced) with these semantics — no save button, and the
  initial mount must NOT post (it would flip engines/plugins).
- Results hotkeys (default / vim, see `src/features/hotkeys.ts`) must not fire
  while focus is in text inputs; hash-only changes (`#image-viewer`) are ignored
  by the router's popstate handler.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; RTL uses Tailwind logical properties (`ps-`,
  `me-`, `start-`, `end-`) against a single stylesheet.
- The empty `searx/templates/<name>/` directory alone registers a theme in the
  UI — never leave a half-created theme dir behind.

## Docs worth reading first

- `client/zjsearch/README.rst` — theme architecture and workflow.
- `docs/dev/templates.rst` — result field reference (the upstream render contract).
- `docs/dev/plugins/` — server plugin registry used by the preferences UI.
